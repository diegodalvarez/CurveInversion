# Curve Inversion
Original work inspired from Stephanie Lo and Roni Israelov at NDVR in their work called What Does an Inverted Yield Curve Mean for Upcoming Interest Rate Movements? [link here](https://ndvr.com/journal/what-does-an-inverted-yield-curve-mean)

The layout of this repository follows
1. Recreating the results within the whitepaper
2. Analayzing the realized volatilities of the yield curve
3. Incorporating Principal Components into the work
4. Analzying market scenarios
